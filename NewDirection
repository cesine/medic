New Direction
-------------


Now that the CLI and CoHo are in place, things are a bit different.

1. Every time there is a commit we are intersted in,
	- Update all repos to HEAD
	- Build mobile spec
	- Launch it on all devices
	- Collect the info in the db

2. No longer worry about being able to provide a SHA and test that SHA
	- Which versions of which plugins would you use?
	
3. Prepare for when all of the mobile spec tests are split into their corresponding repos

4. Evetually, hook this into the CLI so that it is "cli ci" or something like that


Goals:
1. Split out / modularize the build/depoy code (should already be mostly split out)
2. Split out the pubsub code to listen for commits




Just what exaclty is this:   path: '/Users/sesadmin/.cordova/lib/android/cordova-android-dev/dev',
And why can't I build mobile spec manually?
-> Removed that dir, rebuilt everything, and loaded mob spec correctly




Code Clean Up
--------------
Probably don't really even need the /test/ directories and /temp/ stuff any more at all

output path -> Output path where the app gets built in andorid maker is set in libraries.js, the output: object. It's called in build/builder.js.

Using Andrews Script
--------------------
1. Script mostly works; we need to remember to run the install command if getting all of the repos for the first time
2. Strange issue where cordova-plugins-whitelist is coppied into /cordova-mobile-spec/cordova-plugins-whitelist instead of the main /github/, tried to change the path in plugins-dependenies, but couldn't get it, so needed to change it to "../" and al mv cordova-plugins-whitelist ../    Strange
3. When starting the app, it's just teh standard Hello Cordova page. Hmmm...wtf? But in /assets/www/, all of the files are there. But index.html is the helloCordova page. 
	- Has it always been like this? Or do we need to launch spec.html? 
	- No, not spec.html; it has its own index.html with the list and everything. 
	- This shoudul be in /cordova-mobile-spec/index.html, but it's not. So we must copy this over or somethign incorrectly
		- When we clone down the mobile-spec repo, index.html is correct and tehre. So maybe somethign in teh script is overwriting it?
